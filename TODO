basic things to fix : 

    handle running out of memory

    handle sound beep

    have the clock be some division of 60. so if the clock is 700 the cpu frames per frame should be 700/60

extended stuff: 

    have custom stuff on the chip like program counter start and memory amount.

    change the draw instruction and display buffer to output something that is a bit map and not an array of bools
